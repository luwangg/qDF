---- second alpha release

- build Windows installer (excluding msvcrt --- require user to install via
vcredist_XXX.exe for now)
---- first windows alpha release to friendly users

-- Export To Text: allow raw text output of qDF data (including fixes) for
   incident reports, etc.

- Add WMM geomagnetic model and automatic computation of declination
   The new version that creates a library might be usable directly!
- Add setting for changing name of DF fix objects
- Fix up miscellaneous warnings from DFLib (e.g. signed/unsigned compares)
- Allow persistent TCP connection to APRS stream rather than UDP

- Allow user to turn off each display class other than main window in settings
  dialog
- Implement All Topo Maps display class on Windows

- Agrello doppler input?  How to compute SD?

- Practice mode.  Allow input of actual transmitter location, computation of
  bearing error.  Use this to accumulate data for SD computation?

--------
- add computation of bearing/range between any two points (geodesic,
  spherical earth OK)

- add VOR database
- Add bearing/range from VOR for fixes
- add computation of location given bearing/range from VOR
- Add ability to plot airborne reports given bearing/range from VOR or Lat/Lon
  and altitude (use SAR School text for parameters needed to compute footprint)

- Receive APRS data from stream (drop all on floor but DF reports)
- Allow ability to import selected DF reports from APRS stream

--------
- Upload to github?
