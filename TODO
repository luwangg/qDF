- Add setting for default hemisphere.  Use this to initialize N/S, E/W buttons
  in latLonCoordinateWidget for new reports.  Think outside North America,
  since first alpha tester is actually in Norway.  This will require a 
  setDefaultHemisphere method in the widget, too.
- Add computation and display of error ellipses for ML fix.
- Add setting for changing name of DF fix objects
- Fix up miscellaneous warnings from DFLib (e.g. signed/unsigned compares)
- Figure out what the heck happened on Windows --- "release" build crashes
  with no explanation, "debug" works Just Fine.  

- Migrate all calls to display classes into a display manager so that the main
  code displays everything once through the manager, and the manager takes care
  of all the optional displays.
- Allow user to turn off each display class other than main window in settings
  dialog
- Implement KML (preferrably a live one) display class on all platforms.
- Implement All Topo Maps display class on Windows

- Add WMM geomagnetic model and automatic computation of declination
   The new version that creates a library might be usable directly!

- add VOR database
- add computation of bearing/range between any two points (geodesic,
  spherical earth OK)
- Add bearing/range from VOR for fixes
- add computation of location given bearing/range from VOR
- Add ability to plot airborne reports given bearing/range from VOR or Lat/Lon
  and altitude (use SAR School text for parameters needed to compute footprint)

- Allow persistent TCP connection to APRS stream
- Receive APRS data from stream (drop all on floor but DF reports)
- Allow ability to import selected DF reports from APRS stream
